Introduction

This application is a simple e-commerce platform that allows users to browse and purchase products. It is built using ReactJS, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

The application has the following features:

    User authentication and authorization
    Product listing
    Adding/Deleting products as a user

Installation and Setup

To install and set up the application, you will need the following:

    Node.js
    npm

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can install the application dependencies by running the following command:

npm install

To start the application, run the following command:

npm start

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.
Authentication and Authorization

The application uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication and authorization. When a user logs in, a JWT token is generated and stored in the user's browser. This token is then used to authenticate the user for subsequent requests.

The application has the following roles:

    User: Can view products and add them delete them.

Components

The application is divided into the following components:

    ListOfProducts Component: This component renders a list of products.
    AppContent Component: This component is the main container for the application. It renders the header, navigation bar, and main content area.
    LoginForm Component: This component renders a login or registration form.

API Requests

The application interacts with a Spring Boot backend API for data retrieval and manipulation. The API requests are made using the Axios library.
Notifications

The application uses the SweetAlert2 library to display notifications to the user. Notifications are used to inform the user about successful or unsuccessful actions, such as logging in or creating a product.

I hope this documentation is helpful. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you!
